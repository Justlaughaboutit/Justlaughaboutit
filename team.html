        <h2>Owethu</h2>
        <p>I'm Owethu Biyela and l'm a content creator and I believe I can change the world one curated post at a time or one conversation at a time. I come from a small town named Richards Bay, within that small town is a village called @Mandlazini. My origin inspired me to be who I am today and do what I do so passionately. Being From a Village such as this we had limited access to a lot of things and a lot of information" We are also bound by traditions so it was my mission to break that narrative. I would describe this "brand" that I'm building as a set of new eyes to a better reality. I say this because it sheds a light to life beyond my village and conversations and insight to things unspoken of, so in general - a fresh new perspective of a different reality,. I play the role of the fun, overly confident, talkative character, always ready to oppose the non I enjoy conversations around tradition, women empowerment and straitening life of the young and youthful I believe that is what my audience enjoys about me the most - the courage to be so bold and to vocalise things that people only think about put to afraid to do or discuss. If my personality was a tagline, It would probably be along the lines of  "if not now, then when" or “why not”. because, how dare we not dream big? we only nave a little time on this earth to make a difference. What people don’t know is that beyond this boldness - I'm very vulnerable and soft. My background is in performing arts, Recently graduated for diploma In performing art, currently doing Film & television production cause I'm really into media like that. Anything that has to do with spot light count me in always. I'm also a content creator as well which is a pastime of mine and I worked as a Background actor for different productions like Shaka Ilembe S2, Adulting S2, Sbongile & the Dlaminis, uMkhokha, Bad influence as well. What I hope people take from this show - Is courage. The courage to dream bigger than their demarcations. This is for the youth or anyone striving to change.</p>

        <h2>Kamohelo</h2>
        <p>Kamohelo Khalefi was born and bred in White City Jabavu Soweto I am the fourth child out of 5 three brothers and one sister. I started attende school at Rutegang Primary school then went to school Tlhatlogang Secondary school and ended my high school years at Morris Isaacson High school where the school shaped me to be who I am today. I am very introverted person but in the I can my role is more leaned towards thinker and funny. I can say I am a hustler but to some it may sound like a fancy way to say you are unemployed to avoid questioning. Topics that resonate to me are ones that involve township as I from the township but I looking forward to learning more about other topics on the show. Our audience can see as the reasoning person when he speaks about something he validates his points. From each episodes we hope our audience can learn that people have different experiences in life and those experiences have helped build a lot in their lives. I am a more of a just do it kind of person. I am more of reserved person for me to open up I need to feel comfortable around you then you can see I am outspoken. Our target audience are everyday hustlers and those who want to laugh and learn about anything and everything.</p>
